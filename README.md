# Project : Security Assessment and Management on Health Care Clinic
### Story
Cedarville Family Health has provided healthcare services to the small town of
Cedarville Family Health, Rhode Island, for over 40 years. The clinic was founded
by Dr. Thomas Smith, a dedicated medical professional committed to providing
quality care to the community.Ten years ago, Dr. Smith hired
his daughter, Sandra, to be the
office manager. Over the
years, she has transitioned
some of their files to an
electronic format.
### Security Meeting
Despite its long-standing reputation in the community, the clinic has struggled to
keep up with modern information security standards and requirements. Garrett Shaw,
a family friend and the clinic's attorney, has recommended that the clinic review its
data security posture. 

The review has two goals:

. Evaluate and improve
the clinic's current data
security practices.

· Determine changes
needed to comply with
the information security
requirements outlined in
HIPAA.

### Remediation After Security Assessment
Summary of HIPAA rules:

Cedarville Family Health lacks the comprehensive security measures needed to protect e-PHI
 adequately. Current practices, such as staff taking non-encrypted portable hard disk drives offsite,
don't meet the requirements of HIPAA for reasonable and appropriate safeguards.

Using unencrypted portable hard disk drives for data backups means that Cedarville Family Health 
does not adequately protect the confidentiality and integrity of e-PHI. 

Governance and oversight:

The organization has a designated individual explicitly responsible for overseeing cybersecurity policies and procedures.

Comprehensive policies cover all aspects of cybersecurity, including 
prevention, detection, and response, which are needed to enforce security practices consistently and effectively across the organization.

Risk management:

Cedarville Family Health has not established, it means not conducting any regular risk analysis.

Cedarville Family Health has not established, it means not conducting risk assessments and risk mitigation.
